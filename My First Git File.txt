Hi Team! 
I am almost done with Chroma Tech. I am experienced enough to do this. I am knowledgeable enough to do this. I am prepared enough to do this. 
I am mature enough to do this. I am brave enough to do this."

Some Changes
Today I learnt how to add commit

“Inspiration does exist, but it must find you working.” 

pwd - print work directory
ls - list of all directory inside
cd - change directory
cd .. back to previous direction
cd ~ bring to home direction
clear
exit



CHANGE THE LIFE FOR THE BETTER

1. git init
1.1 git status 
2. git add .
3. git commit -m"naming"
4. git push -u origin naming
